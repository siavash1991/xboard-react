/**
 * Configuration File
 *
 * This file serves as a centralized location for managing configuration settings
 * for the application. It can contain various configuration variables that can be
 * accessed and utilized across different parts of the application, making it a
 * valuable resource for future enhancements and scalability.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Define environment-specific variables, such as API endpoints or feature flags.
 * - Store global configuration settings that are consistent across all environments.
 * - Manage theme variables, third-party integrations, or testing configuration.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Centralized management of configuration settings for easier maintenance.
 * - Improved code organization and separation of concerns.
 * - Enables dynamic configuration updates without modifying multiple files.
 * - Facilitates future updates and expansions of the application by providing a
 *   single source of truth for configuration.
